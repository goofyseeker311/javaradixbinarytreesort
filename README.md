# Java Radix Binary Tree Sort and Merge Sort

Radix binary tree sort and merge sort implemented in Java.
Implementations compared to the default Arrays.sort sort run times.
BinaryTree and MergeSort are not optimized in code.

Test conditions: 1K/1M/100M random integers in a flat array.
```
Test setup: 1K/1M/100M
Arrays.sort: 1ms/334ms/57s.
BinaryTree: 3ms/672ms/162s.
MergeSort: 1ms/1006ms/153s.
```
