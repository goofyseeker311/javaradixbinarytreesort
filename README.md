# Java Radix Binary Tree Sort and Merge Sort
Radix binary tree sort and merge sort implemented in Java.
Implementations compared to the default Arrays.sort sort run times.
BinaryTree and MergeSort are not optimized in code.

Test conditions: 1K/1M/100M random integers in a flat array.
Arrays.sort took 1ms/334ms/57s.
BinaryTree took 3ms/672ms/162s.
MergeSort took 1ms/1006ms/153s.
